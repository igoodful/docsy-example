file 模块可以帮助我们完成一些对文件的基本操作。比如，创建文件或目录、删除文件或目录、修改文件权限等

## yum

```bash

[root@k8s-node-77 ansible]# ansible-doc -s yum
- name: Manages packages with the `yum' package manager
  yum:
      allow_downgrade:       # Specify if the named package and version is allowed to downgrade a maybe already installed higher version of that package. Note that setting allow_downgrade=True can make this module behave in a non-idempotent way. The task could end up
                               with a set of packages that does not match the complete list of specified packages to install (because dependencies between the downgraded package and others can cause changes to the packages which were in
                               the earlier transaction).
      autoremove:            # If `yes', removes all "leaf" packages from the system that were originally installed as dependencies of user-installed packages but which are no longer required by any such package. Should be used alone or when state is `absent' NOTE: This
                               feature requires yum >= 3.4.3 (RHEL/CentOS 7+)
      bugfix:                # If set to `yes', and `state=latest' then only installs updates that have been marked bugfix related.
      conf_file:             # The remote yum configuration file to use for the transaction.
      disable_excludes:      # Disable the excludes defined in YUM config files. If set to `all', disables all excludes. If set to `main', disable excludes defined in [main] in yum.conf. If set to `repoid', disable excludes defined for given repo id.
      disable_gpg_check:     # Whether to disable the GPG checking of signatures of packages being installed. Has an effect only if state is `present' or `latest'.
      disable_plugin:        # `Plugin' name to disable for the install/update operation. The disabled plugins will not persist beyond the transaction.
      disablerepo:           # `Repoid' of repositories to disable for the install/update operation. These repos will not persist beyond the transaction. When specifying multiple repos, separate them with a `","'. As of Ansible 2.7, this can alternatively be a list
                               instead of `","' separated string
      download_dir:          # Specifies an alternate directory to store packages. Has an effect only if `download_only' is specified.
      download_only:         # Only download the packages, do not install them.
      enable_plugin:         # `Plugin' name to enable for the install/update operation. The enabled plugin will not persist beyond the transaction.
      enablerepo:            # `Repoid' of repositories to enable for the install/update operation. These repos will not persist beyond the transaction. When specifying multiple repos, separate them with a `","'. As of Ansible 2.7, this can alternatively be a list
                               instead of `","' separated string
      exclude:               # Package name(s) to exclude when state=present, or latest
      install_weak_deps:     # Will also install all packages linked by a weak dependency relation. NOTE: This feature requires yum >= 4 (RHEL/CentOS 8+)
      installroot:           # Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to which all packages will be installed.
      list:                  # Package name to run the equivalent of yum list --show-duplicates <package> against. In addition to listing packages, use can also list the following: `installed', `updates', `available' and `repos'. This parameter is mutually exclusive
                               with `name'.
      lock_timeout:          # Amount of time to wait for the yum lockfile to be freed.
      name:                  # A package name or package specifier with version, like `name-1.0'. If a previous version is specified, the task also needs to turn `allow_downgrade' on. See the `allow_downgrade' documentation for caveats with downgrading packages. When
                               using state=latest, this can be `'*'' which means run `yum -y update'. You can also pass a url or a local path to a rpm file (using state=present). To operate on several packages this can accept a comma
                               separated string of packages or (as of 2.0) a list of packages.
      releasever:            # Specifies an alternative release from which all packages will be installed.
      security:              # If set to `yes', and `state=latest' then only installs updates that have been marked security related.
      skip_broken:           # Skip packages with broken dependencies(devsolve) and are causing problems.
      state:                 # Whether to install (`present' or `installed', `latest'), or remove (`absent' or `removed') a package. `present' and `installed' will simply ensure that a desired package is installed. `latest' will update the specified package if it's not
                               of the latest available version. `absent' and `removed' will remove the specified package. Default is `None', however in effect the default action is `present' unless the `autoremove' option is enabled for
                               this module, then `absent' is inferred.
      update_cache:          # Force yum to check if cache is out of date and redownload if needed. Has an effect only if state is `present' or `latest'.
      update_only:           # When using latest, only update installed packages. Do not install packages. Has an effect only if state is `latest'
      use_backend:           # This module supports `yum' (as it always has), this is known as `yum3'/`YUM3'/`yum-deprecated' by upstream yum developers. As of Ansible 2.7+, this module also supports `YUM4', which is the "new yum" and it has an `dnf' backend. By
                               default, this module will select the backend based on the `ansible_pkg_mgr' fact.
      validate_certs:        # This only applies if using a https url as the source of the rpm. e.g. for localinstall. If set to `no', the SSL certificates will not be validated. This should only set to `no' used on personally controlled sites using self-signed
                               certificates as it avoids verifying the source site. Prior to 2.1 the code worked as if this was set to `yes'.
